# GeoSHPer
GeoSHPer is a JavaScript library for converting shapefile data into GeoJSON. It reads ZIP archives containing .shp, .dbf, and .prj files, parses geographic features and attributes, and supports coordinate transformation using Proj4js. The result is a GeoJSON FeatureCollection, enabling easy integration with web mapping libraries.
